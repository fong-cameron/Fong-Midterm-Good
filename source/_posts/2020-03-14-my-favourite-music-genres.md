Understanding what musical genres you like comes from a lot of trial and error, some genres you instantly know that you like, and some come from hours and hours of appreciation. My favourite genres of music are R&B, Rap, Soul, and Motown. 

My appreciation for these genres comes from my brother and my dad, from a young age my brother loved playing rap and r&b around the house, that is where I first got exposed to legendary artist like Tupac and Notorious BIG, while those might have been considered "mainstream" rappers at the time, they changed the way in which people looked at rap and brought it into the spotlight. 

Motown has a special place in my heard because it is a genre that my dad would play in the car whenever he would drop me off at school. He would play so many different types of Motown but his favourite band was The Temptations. He would BLAST "my girl" by the temptations every single time we were in the car together and we would sing along together. 

The love of music comes from the memories it produces, when a specific song comes on you are able to recall a memory from the time you heard it or what was going on when you first heard it which is special.
