David Ruffin, Otis Williams, Paul Williams, Melvin Franklin and Eddie Kendricks. These are the names of the original Temptations, a group that has a very special place in my heart not only because their music was and still is exceptional but because of the impact that it had on my childhood growing up. 

I first heard The Temptations when my dad played it in the car when we were taking a family road trip to Montreal, he played "Ain't to proud to beg" and I remember seeing both my mom and dad bobbing their heads and singing along (which is a rare sight I think I can count on 1 hand how many times I have seen that happen in my 24 years of life), after that they played the whole album and that was the first time I heard "my girl" being played, ever since then I have been hooked. From papa was a rolling stone to I wish it would rain and every song in between The Temptations have changed the way that I look at music and have given me a greater appreciation for the way in which music has impacted culture around the world.
