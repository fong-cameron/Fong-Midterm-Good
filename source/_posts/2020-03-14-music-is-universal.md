Music is something that is universally loved, being one of the few species who can feel and understand rhythm is what makes music so appealing. Whats special about music is that there are so many different genres which is appealing to everyone. 

Thinking back to when I was a kid my first and fondest memories come from either my parents singing me different songs to put me to bed or cheer me up, hearing nursery songs in school, or singing along to songs on different TV shows like Barney. 

Music is an integral part of our society, and understanding what genres we like can be due to many factors such as what we watched growing up, what our parents listened to at home or in the car, or what your siblings exposed you to at a young age. I believe that music and the genres we like dictate how we grow up and how our personalities develop as we get older.
