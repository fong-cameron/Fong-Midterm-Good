Within the last 20 years RnB has become apart of popular culture, some of the biggest artist today are within the RnB genre, while for generations today this seems normal, this was not something normal back when RnB first began in the late 80s and early 90s. 

There was large resistance when RnB first became a genre, mainly because it was seen as apart of "black culture" which was largely still being rejected at the time. I first discovered RnB from my brother who was obsessed with blasting RnB throughout the house in his new "high tech" boombox. Some of my fondest memories with my brother were him sitting me down and showing me the latest RnB and rap CD's that he had just purchased, and when he first got his car (a Nissan 240).

Modern RnB is much different than RnB in the 80s/90s as there is not as much oppression and cultural injustice as there once was. But the core principles surrounding the music are the same, and that can be heard in albums by artist such as The Weeknd, Drake, Beyonce, and Rihanna.
