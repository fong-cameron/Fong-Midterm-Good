This might be a hot take but I think Motown was the most influential genre of music in the 20th century. There are so many famous artists during the Motown era that have become universally known, some of these include: Smokey Robinson, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, The Jackson 5 (Michael Jackson), The Supremes, Ben E King, The Four Tops, Diana Ross, Rick James, Aretha Franklin, Benny Gordon, the list goes on and on but these artists have changed the way in which music is constructed and not only have they had an incredible impact on music itself but culturally they shifted the tide during a time in which civil unrest was at its peak. 

Motown has a very special place in my heart and I think its a genre that has been under appreciated by the generations that have proceeded it.
